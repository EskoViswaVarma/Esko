Dynamic Subscriptions
Dynamic Subscriptions is a new cloud-based licensing model for 
on-premise applications that simplifies global management and distribution of 
licenses across all sites
More flexibility and less IT administration than named user subscriptions
Better management tools than perpetual licenses
Online cloud portal and cloud services to manage and distribute licenses
For detailed information, we welcome you to have a look at the Licensing 
“What’s New” presentation

Licensing of on-premise applications
Local Licenses
? Activated on client computer
? Can only be used on the computer where it is 
activated
Named User Subscription
? Is a license that is linked to a user (EskoID) instead 
of to a computer
? User can sign in from anywhere on any computer
? 1 license is assigned to 1 user but can be reassigned 
to another user online
Network Licenses
? Distributed by network license server on the local 
network
? Can be used by any computer
? Usage can not exceed #purchased licenses
Dynamic Subscription
? A pool of licenses can be assigned to a group of 
users from any location (EskoID – no # limit)
? Users sign in from anywhere as long as # licenses in 
use does not exceed # purchased licenses
? Licenses are used and freed up dynamically
? Licenses and EskoID groups are managed online
Perpetual Licenses Subscription Licenses
NEW!
